# Welcome to Where am I :question:

Over the developing process of learning ROS and Gazebo, I got to understans several aspects of robotic software engineering with a focus on ROS:

* Create a ROS package that launches a custom robot model in a custom Gazebo world

* Utilize the ROS AMCL package and the Tele-Operation / Navigation Stack to localize the robot

* Explore, add, and tune specific parameters corresponding to each package to achieve the best possible localization results

 ## Summary of tasks in this project
 
 * Set up simualtion: enviroment and robot  
 * Generate ground reference map from Gazebo world
 * Building AMCL launch file 
 * Selecting localization parameters (see: screenshoots folder)
 * Adding teleop node to control robot around the map
 
## Result 
A short demo [videoclip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pzY93kGLI4) (of a success case): can be found on my youtube Channel :boom:
